                    As the earth’s temperature continues to rise, droughts and desertification are likely to increase . With the water supply quickly depleting in these areas, we must discover alternative forms of harvesting water. A resource highly overlooked to help supplement some of the daily water intake is the atmosphere.

                </p>
                <p>
                    “Many ancient cultures collected water from fog by placing large pots under trees and shrubs. As the water from fog collected on these objects, the pots collected the water. This method of water collection was effective, but not as effective as collecting rainwater or other liquid water. “ - National Geographic
                </p>
                <p>
                   Ancient cultures are not the only ones to collect water from fog.  The Opuntia genus of cacti possesses the unique ability to collect water from fog through specially designed spines that condense and move the water towards the base of the spine and into the cactus. 

                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  The dewpoint project modernizes the collection of fog by biomimicking the Opuntia’s spines. Dewpoint is a series of panels with specially designed spine clusters to work as an efficient and sustainable supplement to our current water supply. Each spine has a change in diameter and strategically arranged bumps and vertical lacerations. These characteristic combined enhances the efficiency of the dewpoint spines ability to move water towards the base of the spine and into the collection basin. The dewpoint project is optimizing fog water collection for the modern world.
